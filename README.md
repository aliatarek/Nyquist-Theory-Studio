- [x] Save composed signal
- [x] Browse a signal
- [x] Select sampling rate in hz or normalized to FMax
- [x] Show or hide samples selected
- [x] Reconstruct signal from samples using Nyquist-Shannon theory
- [x] View the difference between original signal and reconstructed signal
- [x] Add noise to the signal using a slider
